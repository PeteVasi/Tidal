            Tidal is a two-player set passing game played with a deck of 32 cards.<LineBreak/>
            You are eliminated if at any time you hold more than thirteen cards in<LineBreak/>
            your hand.  Both players begin with seven cards in their hand.<LineBreak/>
            <LineBreak/>
            During your turn:<LineBreak/>
            1. Draw a card.  Note that if this your fourteenth card, you lose.<LineBreak/>
            2. You may choose to pass as many sets of three cards as you like<LineBreak/>
            to your opponent.  You can do so by dragging the cards from your<LineBreak/>
            hand to the center table.<LineBreak/>
            A set of three cards can be any three cards that all have the same<LineBreak/>
            value, or a set of three cards all in order and of the same suit.<LineBreak/>
            For example, these are both valid sets:<LineBreak/>
            <LineBreak/>
            <LineBreak/>
            <LineBreak/>
            3. If you pass cards, your oppenent can choose sets to keep and<LineBreak/>
            sets to cancel.  For each set that he elects to keep, he must select two<LineBreak/>
            of the three cards to move to his hand and one card to discard.  For<LineBreak/>
            each set that he elects to cancel, he must play a fourth card from his<LineBreak/>
            hand that matches the set of three to cancel.  For example, a fourth<LineBreak/>
            eight could be used to cancel the above set of eights, like this:
